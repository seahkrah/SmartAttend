# EXAMPLES:
#
# feat(auth): add MFA enforcement for superadmin operations
#
# Implement MFA verification middleware that enforces TOTP/SMS/EMAIL
# challenges before any destructive superadmin operations.
#
# Fixes #456
#
# ---
#
# fix(backend): prevent race condition in tenant lifecycle transitions
#
# Wrap state transition in database transaction to ensure atomicity
# of audit log + state change. Prevents partial updates.
#
# Relates to #123
#
# ---
#
# refactor(api): consolidate error response format across superadmin routes
#
# All endpoints now return consistent ErrorContract structure with
# code, message, recoveryHint, timestamp, and requestId fields.
#
# This improves client-side error handling and debugging.
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: Error response format has changed from field-based
# to structured ErrorContract. Clients must update error handling.
