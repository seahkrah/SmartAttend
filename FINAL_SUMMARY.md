## 💻 How to Use

### For Users
When they see an error, it now tells them clearly what's wrong:

```
"Invalid email or password. Please try again"
→ User knows to check their login credentials

"This email is already registered"
→ User knows to use a different email or login

"Network connection failed. Please check your internet"
→ User knows to check their internet connection
```

### For Developers
Super easy to add error handling anywhere:

```typescript
import { getUserFriendlyError } from '../utils/errorMessages';

try {
  await apiCall();
} catch (error) {
  const userMessage = getUserFriendlyError(error);
  // Show to user or log it
}
```
