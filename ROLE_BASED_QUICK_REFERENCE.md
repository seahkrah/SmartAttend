# 🎯 Role-Based Access Control - Quick Reference

## What You Asked For
> "Implement role based for each platform. If school is selected for registration, the user should be able to choose whether they're student, faculty or admin. Faculty and IT roles should go to the admin account for each school for approval while for corporate, users should be able to select whether they employee, IT or HR (the admin account of each corporate entity should be able to approve users related to their insitution as well). I want it to be in this structure and layout because it is possible for more than one school and more than one corporate entity using the platform (so we cannot have data mixing up). Let everyone be able to see data that are relevant to them"

## ✅ What You Got

### 1. **Multi-Entity Structure**
- ✅ Multiple schools can use the platform (each isolated)
- ✅ Multiple corporate entities can use the platform (each isolated)
- ✅ New database tables: `school_entities`, `corporate_entities`
- ✅ New association tables: `school_user_associations`, `corporate_user_associations`

### 2. **Role-Based Registration**

**School Platform:**
```
Student      → Auto-approved ✅ (can login immediately)
Faculty      → Requires school admin approval ⏳
IT           → Requires school admin approval ⏳
```

**Corporate Platform:**
```
Employee     → Auto-approved ✅ (can login immediately)
IT           → Requires corporate admin approval ⏳
HR           → Requires corporate admin approval ⏳
```

### 3. **Approval Workflow**

**Backend Implementation:**
- ✅ `registerUserWithRole()` - Role-based registration with approval logic
- ✅ `getPendingApprovalsForAdmin()` - View pending requests
- ✅ `approveOrRejectRegistration()` - Approve or reject registrations

**API Endpoints:**
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/register-with-role` - Register with role
- ✅ `GET /api/auth/admin/pending-approvals` - Admin sees pending
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/admin/approval-action` - Admin approve/reject

### 4. **Frontend Features**

**Registration Page (`RegisterPage.tsx`):**
- ✅ Platform selection (School/Corporate)
- ✅ Role selection with approval indicators
- ✅ Organization/Entity selection
- ✅ Success screen showing approval status
- ✅ Clear messaging about approval requirements

**Admin Approval Dashboard (`AdminApprovalDashboard.tsx`):**
- ✅ View all pending approvals
- ✅ Separated by School and Corporate
- ✅ One-click approve or reject
- ✅ Optional rejection reason
- ✅ Real-time updates

### 5. **Data Isolation**

**By Entity:**
```
School A → Students only see School A data
        → Faculty only see School A data
        → Cannot see School B data
```

**By Role:**
```
Student → Can only see own data
Faculty → Can see student data for own courses
IT      → Can see system-wide data
```

**Query Example:**
```sql
-- When loading students, always filter by entity
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE school_entity_id = $1  -- Only this school's students
AND is_active = true;
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### New Tables (6)

```
school_entities ────────┐
                        ├─→ school_user_associations
corporate_entities ─────┤
                        ├─→ corporate_user_associations
                        │
                        ├─→ school_user_approvals
                        │
                        └─→ corporate_user_approvals
```

### User Lifecycle

**Auto-Approved (Student/Employee):**
```
Register → User created (active) → Can login immediately ✅
```

**Requires Approval (Faculty/IT/HR):**
```
Register → User created (inactive) → Approval request created ⏳
     ↓
Admin reviews → Approve → User activated → Can login ✅
             ↓
             Reject → User deleted ✗
```

## 🎯 Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Student Registration
```
1. John registers as "Student" at "Primary University"
2. System: Creates user (active), creates association
3. Response: "You can now log in" ✅
4. John logs in immediately ✅
```

### Workflow 2: Faculty Registration
```
1. Dr. Smith registers as "Faculty" at "Primary University"
2. System: Creates user (inactive), creates approval request
3. Response: "Pending admin approval" ⏳
4. School admin sees in dashboard
5. Admin clicks "Approve"
6. System: Activates user, creates association
7. Dr. Smith can now log in ✅
```

### Workflow 3: Multi-School Isolation
```
1. John registers as Student at "Primary University" → Primary data visible
2. Jane registers as Student at "Secondary University" → Secondary data visible
3. John logs in → Sees Primary Uni courses only ✅
4. Jane logs in → Sees Secondary Uni courses only ✅
5. John cannot see Jane's data ✗
6. Jane cannot see John's data ✗
```
